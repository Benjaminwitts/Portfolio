      <h3>
        Hi, I'm Benjamin Witts, an 18 year old student at the Metis Montessori Lyceum. This is my final year at the school. 
        My father is from England while my mother is from the Netherlands. I have raised bilingual, being able to speak both Dutch and English fluently.
        In my free time I enjoy spending time with my friends, playing videogames and comitting bloody murders.
        I mainly program in C++ and Python, though I have made many projects in other languages.
